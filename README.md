# Supply Chain Tracking System

A blockchain-based supply chain tracking system that provides transparency and traceability for products throughout their journey from manufacturer to consumer.

## Project Description

The Supply Chain Tracking System is a decentralized application built on blockchain technology that enables transparent tracking of products through various stages of the supply chain. This system allows manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and consumers to verify the authenticity, location, and status of products in real-time.

The smart contract provides immutable record-keeping for product registration, ownership transfers, and status updates, ensuring data integrity and preventing fraud in supply chain operations. Each product is assigned a unique identifier and can be traced back to its origin, providing complete visibility into its journey.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize supply chain management by leveraging blockchain technology to create a transparent, secure, and efficient tracking system. We aim to:

- **Eliminate Counterfeiting**: Provide authentic product verification through immutable blockchain records
- **Enhance Consumer Trust**: Enable consumers to verify product origins and journey
- **Improve Compliance**: Help businesses meet regulatory requirements with transparent record-keeping
- **Reduce Fraud**: Prevent unauthorized modifications to product information
- **Enable Quick Recalls**: Facilitate rapid identification and recall of problematic products
- **Support Sustainability**: Track environmental impact and ethical sourcing practices

## Key Features

### üè≠ **Product Registration**
- Register new products with detailed information including name, description, and batch ID
- Assign unique identifiers to each product for lifetime tracking
- Record manufacturer information and initial location

### üîÑ **Ownership Transfer**
- Secure transfer of product ownership between authorized entities
- Automatic status updates during transfers
- Location tracking throughout the supply chain
- Event logging for complete audit trail

### üìä **Status Management**
- Real-time product status updates (Manufactured, In Transit, Delivered, Recalled)
- Location tracking with timestamp records
- Batch management for grouped products
- Authorized entity management for secure operations

### üîê **Security & Authorization**
- Role-based access control for different supply chain participants
- Admin functions for managing authorized entities
- Ownership verification before allowing updates
- Protection against unauthorized modifications

### üîç **Transparency & Traceability**
- Complete product history from manufacturing to delivery
- Batch tracking for quality control and recalls
- Public verification of product authenticity
- Immutable record keeping on blockchain

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contract Features
